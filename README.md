**🌿 Automated Tobacco Leaf Grading Using Hybrid Deep Learning**


This project focuses on automated quality grading of tobacco leaves using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal is to replace manual inspection with a reliable, consistent, and scalable AI-based solution.

The system classifies tobacco leaf images into different quality grades by learning visual features such as texture, color, and shape from images.
